- To start this Binary lesson I will tell you that we will be working with 8-bit binary numbers
- 8-bit numbers can display values from 0-255 all using a combination of 0s and 1s!
- Firstly 00000000 represnts 0, 11111111 represnts 255.
- What exactly do each of these 1s and 0s mean?
- Binary is read from right to left typically, with 00000001 representing the decimal number 1
- With each value you move to the left symbolizing double the number before hand. If 0001 is 1 then 0010 would be 2 and 0100 would be 4
- Using a combination of this new found knowledge will help you be able to make larger numbers using addition
-

- This can also be used in reverse, you may be given a decimal number and asked to represent it in binary
- Think of it as checking off boxes, you check the box for the largest number needed first then slowly go down until you reach the number
- Here is an example, to represent 101 in binary first you will go to the closest value that doesn't exceed 101, which is 64.
- So far we have 01000000, next find the next highet value that can be added to 64 that will not exceed 101, which is 32
- Now we have 01100000, continue this cycle until you represent 101, we are at 96 right now but the next number needed would be
